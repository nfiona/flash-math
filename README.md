                               ***** MATH FLASH GAME *****

This simple yet refreshing game was created using utilization of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies. By combining, the three elements together, it lets player do a quick brain exercise for the young and old, wherever, whenever..

The idea of this game is quite simple. It is developed for users to gain the benefits of mental mathematics, which is mostly to sharpen the mind and increase agility and intelligence (for more info on mental mathematics, visit: http://focusacademy.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.pageview&storyid=13&chnl=19).
Players should be able to answer simple math question (hopefully without a calculator), and with the correct answer, move on to the next question. Once a set of questions are answered correctly, the game should restart automatically, and user can then do their brain exercise all over again.
Younger players should be able to use this game to brush up their math skills or as a quick exercise before school quiz. This will also help increase their interest in math.
Older players will also be benefited by the directness in the games' user interface. Our motto: Less is More!!



Some of the approaches taken were visual simplicity, flexible usability (using click or enter button), and automatic reset.

This game is still at its very beginning stage and list of improvements are on their way.  New functionalities such as score tracking, timed-game, multi level games, and random questions are just few of the many exciting features currently being planned.
