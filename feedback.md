 ## Code Comments:

 Take a look at my inline code comments in the pull request for specific notes on code. Suggestions for added functionality include prompts to alert the user to a correct answer, a score board and a timer.

 ## Deployment:

 > Did you successfully deploy your project to github pages? Is the app's functionality the same deployed as it is locally?

 **1: Progressing.** The deployed app is working, but I did have to help you get it there.

 ## Technical Requirements:

 > Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

 **2: Performing.**

 ## Code Quality:

 > Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

 **1: Progressing.** Your code was difficult to read at times. Try to be more mindful of proper indentation practices.

 ## Creativity/Interface:

 > Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

 **2: Performing.** Minimalist themes are totally fine, an aesthetic I prefer actually. But try to make sure the layout looks ok. The interface is kind of small to play on and the buttons are difficult to read.
